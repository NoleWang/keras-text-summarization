 pubnub android webrtc signaling api android arsenal https img shields io badge android arsenal android webrtc api green svg style flat https android arsenal com details cover img http kevingleason me android webrtc api assets pnwebrtc png version https img shields io badge current version green svg style flat pnwebrtc is an android module that makes webrtc signaling easy view the official pnwebrtc javadoc here javadoc note this api uses pubnub for signaling to transfer the metadata and establish the peer to peer connection once the connection is established the video and voice runs on public google stun turn servers keep in mind pubnub can provide the signaling for webrtc and requires you to combine it with a hosted webrtc solution for more detail on what pubnub does and what pubnub doesn t do with webrtc check out this article https support pubnub com support solutions articles does pubnub provide webrtc and video chat usage instructions you have two options the first involves compiling your own binaries and the second uses the hosted library from pristine i strongly recommend you take the second path since it is much quicker and cleaner compiling your own webrtc binaries the pubnub android webrtc signaling api was compiled using pristine s https pristine io hosted webrtc library if you wish to compile your own webrtc binaries follow this guide nativeandroid then clone this repository and import it as a module you will have to modify the module s build gradle and use your own version codes using pristine s webrtc binaries when getting started i recommend this method it is quick and pristine keeps up to date with their webrtc libraries permissions and dependencies in your application s build gradle you will first need to include a few dependencies first the webrtc library from pristine second include the pubnub signaling library optionally you may include the pubnub android sdk i recommend including it as it is useful in messaging presence and signaling features gradle dependencies compile io pristine libjingle aar compile me kevingleason pnwebrtc aar compile com pubnub pubnub android optional then in your application s androidmanifest xml you will need to grant the following permissions for both pubnub and webrtc to function properly xml webrtc dependencies uses feature android name android hardware camera uses feature android name android

receive permission android name your package name permission c d message android protectionlevel signature uses permission android name your package name permission c d message using pnwebrtc in an activity pnwebrtc is a signaling service meaning you will have to gather video and audio resources separately using the webrtc android sdk but this is easy in your video chatting activity initialize the peerconnectionfactory with your application context and some options with these configurations set we can create an instance of a peerconnectionfactory to create audio and video tracks java peerconnectionfactory initializeandroidglobals this context true audio enabled true video enabled true hardware acceleration enabled null render egl context peerconnectionfactory pcfactory new peerconnectionfactory these globals effect the pnpeerconnectionclient as well so set them before instantiating your pnwebrtcclient pnwebrtcclient constraints and settings pnwebrtcclient contains everything you will need to develop video chat applications this class has all the functions for signaling with webrtc protocols including sdp offer options offeroptions known as mediaconstraints you are allowed to define custom mediaconstraints for the client and default values are used if you do not the default values look as follows peerconnection constraint value dtlssrtpkeyagreement true offertoreceiveaudio false offertoreceivevideo true video constraint value maxwidth maxheight minwidth minheight audio constraint value none optional to create your own constraints use pnrtcclient setsignalparams pnsignalingparams params java mediaconstraints videoconstraints new mediaconstraints videoconstraints mandatory add new mediaconstraints keyvaluepair maxwidth pnsignalingparams params new pnsignalingparams pcconstraints videoconstraints audioconstraints pnrtcclient setsignalparams params pnsignalingparams holds all the constraints for a peerconnection video and audio as well as the list of ice servers to set up custom ice servers you may instantiate your pnsignalingparams using a list iceserver note all arguments to pnsignalingparams may be null a null value will simply use the default constraint ice server pnrtclistener callbacks pnrtclistener is an abstract class that should be extended to implement all desired webrtc callbacks this is what connects and powers your application the callbacks that are defined in the pubnub signaling api are listener callback description oncallready string callid called when you are ready to receive a webrtc connection onconnected string userid called when you have successfully subscribed to a pubnub channel and are ready to receive a webrtc connection onpeerstatuschanged pnpeer peer called whenever a pnpeer s connection status is changed can be connecting connected or disconnected onpeerconnectionclosed pnpeer peer called when a pnpeer closes the webrtc connection onlocalstream mediastream localstream called when local mediastream is ready and attached using pnrtcclient setlocalstream onaddremotestream mediastream remotestream pnpeer peer called when a remote stream is added after being connected to a peer onremoveremotestream mediastream remotestream pnpeer peer called when a peer removes their mediastream onmessage pnpeer peer object message called when a user message is transmitted using pnrtcclient transmituser or pnrtcclient transmitall for chat and utility ondebug pnrtcmessage message called throughout signaling procedures helpful for finding webrtc related errors the best way of extending this is using a private class nested in your video activity that extends pnrtclistener and implements the callbacks as you app requires java private class demortclistener extends pnrtclistener override public void onlocalstream final mediastream localstream videochatactivity this runonuithread new runnable override public void run localstream videotracks get addrenderer new videorenderer localrender override public void onaddremotestream final mediastream remotestream final pnpeer peer handle remote stream added override public void onmessage pnpeer peer object message handle message override public void onpeerconnectionclosed pnpeer peer quit back to mainactivity intent intent new intent videochatactivity this mainactivity class startactivity intent finish then add the listener to your pnrtcclient using java pnrtcclient attachrtclistener new demortclistener it is important that you attach the callbacks to your pnrtcclient before creating connections or attaching local media stream since default callbacks none are used prior to calling attachrtclistener using video and audio tracks with webrtc you share create a mediastream and attach it to your peerconnection s to begin chatting you can access camera mic resources using the default or custom constraints you defined in the pnsignalingparams of your pnrtcclient once you have gathered the desired video and audio tracks you can create a mediastream and attach it to the pnrtcclient java ex create a video source then we can make a video track to stream localvideosource pcfactory createvideosource capturer this pnrtcclient videoconstraints videotrack localvideotrack pcfactory createvideotrack video track id localvideosource note that local media stream id can be any string mediastream mediastream pcfactory createlocalmediastream local media stream id mediastream addtrack localaudiotrack pnrtcclient attachlocalmediastream mediastream this will trigger you pnrtclistener s onlocalstream callback where you should display it on a glsurfaceview listening for a connection all your resources callbacks and configurations are now set up you are ready to listen for a webrtc connection this is simply a pubnub subscribe pn android which will configure a webrtc peerconnection and handle all sdp signaling java pnrtcclient setmaxconnections pnrtcclient listenon username this will only allow one incoming peerconnection at a time meaning this code could be used for to connections if you don t call setmaxconnections your app will allow all connections then listenon will subscribe you to your call channel so that you may begin receiving calls it is important to note that the username you listen on should be unique much like a phone number now we are ready to place a call creating peer connections to create a connection with a peer they must first be listening on that channel e g they have called pnrtcclient listenon string user you can then create a connection with that username by calling pnrtcclient connect string user java pnrtcclient connect username in practice this will only be used to create the rtc peerconnection all other signaling to get to that point from other activities or fragments should probably be coordinated by a separate pubnub instance possibly using push notifications my practice has been reserving the stdby suffix from usernames and using it as the standby pub sub channel for each user a user will be subscribed to their stdby channel in all other activities until it is time to create a peerconnection to another user ending peer connections to close a connection you have two options one being the classing phone hangup where a user is done talking and thus all connections to and from that user are closed use pnrctclient closeallconnection to accomplish the classic hangup the other is to close a connection with a single peer this feature would use pnrtcclient closeconnection username java close all connections pnrtcclient closeallconnections close a single connection pnrtcclient closeconnection username both will disconnect the peerconnection and send a hangup signal via a pubnub publish pn android sending user messages there are methods of pnrtcclient that allow you to publish a message to all some users you are currently connected with if you wish every user in your chat to receive the message use pnrtcclient transmitall jsonobject message if you intend the message to go to a single user call pnrtcclient transmit string user jsonobject message instead java jsonobject message new jsonobject message put name kevin gleason message put message hello webrtc pnrtcclient transmitall message pnrtcclient transmit username message on pause resume common practice for webrtc applications involves stopping your mediastream when you background the app to do this override onpause and pause the glsurfaceview from rendering video then stop your videosource java override protected void onpause super onpause this videoview onpause glsurfaceview this localvideosource stop videosource to start both these functionalities back up also override onresume to resume the glsurfaceview and videosource java override protected void onresume super onresume this videoview onresume glsurfaceview this localvideosource restart videosource on destroy finally you should override ondestroy to properly prepare all objects for garbage collection java override protected void ondestroy super ondestroy if this localvideosource null this localvideosource stop if this pnrtcclient null this pnrtcclient ondestroy we stop our local video source so that it will not continue streaming after we have left the video activity we then call pnrtcclient ondestroy which cleans up the client and closes all open connections static methods hangup and user message if you need to communicate with pnrtcclient instances in situations where no client exists in your activity perhaps an accept reject call activity there are static methods that handle this for you with any pubnub instance if you need to generate a hangup message to reject a call you can do that as follows with a simple pubnub instance java jsonobject hangupmsg pnpeerconnectionclient generatehanguppacket myusername this mpubnub publish usercalling hangupmsg new callback override public void successcallback string channel object message intent intent new intent incomingcallactivity this mainactivity class startactivity intent simply pass your username to pnpeerconnectionclient generatehanguppacket string user and publish the returned jsonobject to the user who is calling the same goes for user messages with any pubnub object you can send a message through the usermessage protocol using pnpeerconnectionclient generateusermessage string user jsonobject message again pass your username and a json message this will return a jsonobject of the proper format that you can publish to any user the same way as a hangup want some more

rebound compile com tumblr backboard getting started backboard is a framework on top of rebound http facebook github io rebound that manages how springs are used and simplifies the most common use cases actions such as motionevents are mapped to springs via imitators springs are mapped to views and view properties via performers in addition an actor wraps the above objects and provides a simple interface for mapping touch motion to a view s position dragging performers a performer takes the current value of a spring and sets it as the value of a view property java spring bounce springsystem create createspring performer xmotion new performer view view translation x bounce addlistener xmotion for those saving screen space a fluent interface http en wikipedia org wiki fluent interface is available java spring bounce springsystem create createspring addlistener new performer view view translation x imitators an imitator constantly perturbs the spring it is attached to this perturbation can originate a variety of sources a motionevent where the spring can change based on the action action down action up or imitate a property x y etc these are called eventimitators another spring which leads to results similar to springs being chained together these are called springimitators imitating touch an eventimitator primarily operates with ontouchlisteners the simplest example is a toggleimitator which toggles between two different values depending on the touch state java view setontouchlistener new toggleimitator spring when the user touches the view a value of is set on the spring and when the user releases a value of is set imitating motion a motionimitator is a special type of eventimitator that maps x and y movement to a spring this is done with motionproperty enums which specifies which methods to call in a motionevent object for example motionproperty x getvalue motionevent calls event getx it also specifies the view property to animate motionevent x getviewproperty corresponds to view translation x this is useful for the actor builder later on in addition tracking and following strategies allow for customization of how the event value is mapped to the spring tracking strategies two tracking strategies are available to configure how an imitator tracks its imitatee track absolute maps the imitatee value directly to the spring track delta maps the change in the imitatee value relative to the initial touch to the spring follow strategies two follow strategies are available to configure how the spring is updated follow exact maps the imitatee value directly to the current and end value of the spring follow spring maps the imitatee value to the end value of the spring which allows the spring to overshoot the current position imitating springs a springimitator is also a springlistener when the spring it is imitating updates it updates the end value of the spring it is controlling usage is simple java springsystem springsystem springsystem create spring leader springsystem createspring spring follower springsystem createspring springimitator follow new springimitator follower leader addlistener follow actors even though backboard reduces a significant amount of boilerplate code the actor class further simplifes view motion by connecting each component together it also manages a view ontouchlistener a motionlistener

dimensions java actor actor new actor builder springsystem create view addtranslatemotion motionproperty x addtranslatemotion motionproperty y build two calls to addtranslatemotion motionproperty are needed because each axis is independent of the other the builder will create an ontouchlistener and attach it to the view as well as a spring with the default settings a performer is also created and attached to the spring when there is a touch event it is passed to the motionimitator which perturbs the spring which moves the view it is also possible to supply your own springsystem spring motionimitator and performer and the builder will properly connect them the first example above can also be expressed as java springsystem springsystem springsystem create spring spring springsystem createspring actor verbose new actor builder springsystem view addmotion spring new motionimitator spring motionproperty x new performer view view translation x build the view can be also left out of the constructor of the performer and the spring out of the motionimitator using the default springconfig since the builder will connect them java actor walk new actor builder springsystem create walker addmotion new motionimitator motionproperty x new performer view translation x build which can be further simplified to java actor run new actor builder springsystem create runner addmotion motionproperty x view translation x build and for more sugar the previous case java actor bolt new actor builder springsystem create bolter addtranslatemotion motionproperty x build actor options requestdisallowtouchevent causes the actor to call viewparent requestdisallowtouchevent true which is helpful when the view is inside a listview or another view that captures touch events

 deprecated official android support library http android developers blogspot ru android support library html added support for vector drawables and animated vector drawables please use that this lib is still usable but it is no longer maintained bettervectordrawable the vectordrawable https developer android com reference android graphics drawable vectordrawable html implementation for android api level or greater alternative to the automatic generation of pngs from vector drawables at build time by android plugin for gradle the lib saves apk size and properly supports svg s fill rule see below paths filltype attribute xamarin version of bettervectordrawable can be found here https github com vysotskivadim xamarinbettervectordrawable keywords vector drawable support library compat svg attaching the library jcenter https img shields io github release a student bettervectordrawable svg attaching the library the lib is deployed to the jcenter repository so just add this line to the build gradle dependencies section groovy compile com bettervectordrawable lib in addition you will need to disable automatic generation of pngs at build time by adding generateddensities line to the defaultconfig section groovy defaultconfig generateddensities usage inflating java drawable drawable vectordrawablecompat inflate getresources r drawable your vector or if resource interception is enabled see below for how to enable drawable drawable getresources getdrawable r drawable your vector there is an overload of the first method with a boolean parameter which allows to force system handling of vector drawables on android however using this overload is not recommended because system implementation of vectordrawable does not support some extra features like path s filltype attribute see below the second method is advised to always use because it allows the system to cache the drawable and hence is more efficient referencing vector drawables from other xml resources it is possible to reference vector drawables from other drawable or layout xml resources as regular drawables for this feature to work you need to enable resource interception extend the application class and override the oncreate method do not forget to modify androidmanifest xml accordingly see the demo app call java vectordrawablecompat enableresourceinterceptionfor getresources from the oncreate method the last parameter is a list of vector resource ids for which interception must be enabled there are three ways to obtain the list if you are not sure what way to choose try to measure the performance of the each method very convenient but relatively slow java int ids vectordrawablecompat findallvectorresourceidsslow getresources r drawable class vectordrawablecompat enableresourceinterceptionfor getresources ids this method scans through all drawable xml resources and ensures that each returned resource has vector data inside usually it is ok to use this method by default nevertheless it may increase application startup time on old devises if the app has many drawable resources of any type less convenient but faster java int ids vectordrawablecompat findvectorresourceidsbyconvention getresources r drawable class convention resource name has vector suffix vectordrawablecompat enableresourceinterceptionfor getresources ids this method uses resource naming convention to find vector resources it relies on that every vector resource name matches vector pattern or vector pattern or both this can be controlled by the resourcenamingconvention parameter the fastest but inconvenient java vectordrawablecompat enableresourceinterceptionfor getresources r drawable your vector r drawable your vector r drawable your vector just enumerate vector drawable resource ids manually converting svgs to vector drawables when parsing xml resources android ignores xml attributes that aren t supported by the current device this is why you have to duplicate unsupported android attributes in the vector drawable xmls for example xml vector xmlns android http schemas android com apk res android xmlns better http schemas android com apk res auto android width dp android height dp android viewportheight android viewportwidth better viewportheight better viewportwidth for a complete list of attributes which must be duplicated see attrs xml lib src main res values attrs xml l duplicate attributes do not have android prefix to make it easier for you use svg to vectordrawable converter https github com a student svgtovectordrawableconverter to produce vector drawables for this lib append to the converter command the lib bettervectordrawable argument like svg vd exe i lib bettervectordrawable this command creates vector drawables containing additional attributes that are understandable by the lib converting vector drawable to bitmap the lib contains the util class that allows you to convert almost any drawable to a bitmap read more docs bitmaputil md path s filltype attribute the lib additionally supports specifying better filltype attribute on a path this gives you ability to control how the inside of the path is determined it corresponds to the fill rule attribute in svg and accepts two values winding nonzero in svg and even odd evenodd in svg issues if you have any problems with the lib please create an issue on github

 processing cardboard this repository is an implementation of processing android with google vr sdk for android cardboard with this code you can write processing sketches for android apps to use stereo graphics photo and google vr cardboard features the objective of this work is to provide an easier development platform by using processing to learn about and program google vr android apps intended for the cardboard hmd head mounted device viewer the processing android core library was modified to use the google vr cardboard sdk replacing the main draw thread with the cardboard rendering thread the processing android core library has an abstraction layer for opengl that makes it possible to write an android cardboard app without using direct android opengl calls included are example android apps for google vr cardboard to demonstrate coding with the processing language for android library and the google cardboard android sdk processing with cardboard vr sdk is an alternative for writing android vr applications it is another way to use explore learn the cardboard vr app development platform transion screenshot screenshot png displayobj screenshot screenshot png implementation works with android studio build tools google vr sdk for android libraries version aar files from jcenter based on processing for android library version rc android mode as of with processing android core source code from https github com processing processing android based on stereo library source code from https github com creativecodinglab stereo minimum builds supports android api platform and above androidmanifest xml is set for kitkat tested with sony z s phone x pixel display running android version with gpu hardware accelerator tested with samsung galaxy s phone x pixel display running android version processing android modifications modified the processing android core library to work directly with the google vr sdk for android cardboard papplet extends

for left and right eye in processing headtransform drawleft drawright sketchsurfaceview extends gvrview sketchsurfaceviewgl extends gvrview gvrview rendering uses gvrview stereorenderer gvrview renderer code is also available but not used added pstereo class for stereo view control added external keyboard codes for remote bluetooth controller key press moved processing opengl shaders folder to assets folder the following processing android core files were modified for this conversion pgl java pgles java pgraphicsopengl java papplet java pconstants java pgraphics java pgraphicsandroid d java pimage java example app description the repository has two example apps mainactivity displays a stereo photo cube in front of a stereo photo background in the cardboard viewer the user may change the viewing angle and size of the cube with head movement a screen tap will bring the cube back to its original location tilting the hmd viewer left or right will change the cube size the app examples also show how to display text and graphics reticle no distortion correction no distortion correction screenshot screenshot png distortion correction enabled distortion correction screenshot screenshot png issues out of memory can result when using large images or restarting the app images need to be recycled by the app when finished line drawing to the screen directly is very slow processing android opengl updates distortion correction can be enabled but the eye separation may need adjustment for viewing the display may not be distorted enough to matter with some unofficial cardboard viewer lens and home made cardboard viewer with stereoscopic quality wide field of view lens text and line drawing now work on screen directly in the correct eye viewport modifications to use cardboard libraries version modifications to use google vr sdk for android cardboard version removed use of android opengl glsurfaceview in papplet because it is not accessible with google vr sdk version increase matrix stack depth modifications to use google vr sdk for android cardboard version this is now labeled stereo mode by google to distinguish from android release n vr mode add constants for more keys used by bluetooth remote controllers modifications to use google vr sdk for android cardboard version use android studio modifications to use google vr sdk for android cardboard version use android studio modifications to use google vr sdk for android cardboard version use android studio change the headtransform positioning logic update to android sdk notes the magnet pull trigger is no longer supported please use cardboard v headset no library build is defined here to make a processing android sdk library or mode for use with the processing ide starting with google vr sdk version the minimum build is for android this happens to be better for faster image photo processing and display with release google removed capability to not display the alignment marker and settings button processing coding notes you must include a call to background in the draw method if not the result will be that nothing appears on the screen in vr mode google vr sdk expects each frame to be redrawn in vr mode so you cannot assume graphics to remain on the screen or built up with each frame however in monocular mode vr mode disabled the screen can be built up with graphics until a call is made to background when using distortion correction default enabled you may need to adjust the eyeseparation parameter to suit the example apps assume distortion correction

artifactid bridge artifactid version version type pom type dependency requests the request api in bridge is very easy to use request basics the code below will request google s homepage java request request bridge get https www google com request bridge allows you to pass format args into request urls this applies to get post put delete etc java request request bridge get https www google com search q s searchquery request there are two advantages to doing this when your requests require query parameters code readability is improved no string concatenation is necessary the contents of the searchquery variable are automatically url encoded for you e g spaces are replaced with request headers adding or changing request headers is pretty simple java request request bridge get https www google com header user agent my app header customheader helloworld request if you had the need to do so you could also set a map of headers with the headers map string object method note the configuration https github com afollestad bridge configuration goes over how you can set default headers for all requests request authentication out of the box bridge supports basic http auth java basicauthentication auth basicauthentication create username password request request bridge get https www idk com private html authentication auth request any class which implements the authentication interface can be passed through authentication request retries at a basic level retries are easy just provide a number indicating the max allowed retries along with how long you want to pause between retries this will retry up to times if a request isn t successful for any reason it will wait milliseconds seconds between each retry java bridge get http test com throwifnotsuccess retries request at an advanced level you can control quite a lot if you provide a retry callback you can decide whether or not you want to actually retry again up to the specified amount of total retries by returning true or false you can see the response of the failed request if any an exception representing why the request failed and a requestbuilder that you can use to modify the next retry request before it gets made java bridge get http test com throwifnotsuccess retries new retrycallback override public boolean onwillretry nullable response previousresponse bridgeexception problem requestbuilder newrequest if previousresponse null previousresponse code don t allow retry if there was a internal server error return false if previousresponse code if we were unauthorized set different login credentials before the next retry newrequest authentication basicauthentication create username new password allow retry return true request request bodies a lot of networking libraries make request bodies a bit difficult bridge aims to make them easy plain bodies a description shouldn t be necessary for this java string postcontent hello how are you request request bridge post https someurl com post js body postcontent request in addition to passing a string other types of plain bodies include byte jsonobject jsonarray there are other types of bodies discussed in the next few sections along with in the request conversion https github com afollestad bridge request conversion section at the bottom which is a bit more advanced form bodies form s are commonly used with put post requests they re basically the same thing as query strings with get requests but the parameters are included in the body of the request rather than the url java form form new form add username aidan add password hello request request bridge post https someurl com login js body form request multipartform bodies a multipartform is a bit different than a regular form content is added as a part to the request body the content is included as raw data associated with a content type allowing you to include entire files multipart forms are commonly used in html forms e g a contact form on a website and they can be used for uploading files to a website java multipartform form new multipartform add subject hello add body hey how are you add fileupload new file sdcard download toupload txt add fileupload toupload mp pipe forfile new file sdcard download toupload mp request request bridge post https someurl com post js body form request this will automatically set the content type header to multipart form data note multipartform has an add method that accepts a pipe this can be used to add parts from streams see the section below on how pipe is used add for file objects is actually using this indirectly for you streaming bodies bridge s pipe api allows you to easily stream data directly into a post body java pipe pipe new pipe byte content hello this is a streaming example getbytes override public string hash creates a unique identifier based on the content being sent used for duplicate request handling return hashutil hash content override public void writeto nonnull outputstream os nullable progresscallback progresslistener throws ioexception os write content notify optional progress listener that all data was transferred if progresslistener null progresslistener publishprogress content length content length nonnull override public string contenttype text plain since we are sending bytes that represent a string or plain text return text plain override public int contentlength throws ioexception return content length override public void close unused for this simple example usually you would close streams and release resources request request bridge post https someurl com post php body pipe request note the value returned for contenttype in the pipe is automatically set to the value of the associated header you can override that by changing the header after the body is set pipe has two static convenience methods that create a pre built pipe instance for certain uses java pipe filepipe pipe forfile new file sdcard myfile txt inputstream is pipe transferpipe pipe forstream is text plain unique identifier such as file name they should be mostly self explanatory on android if you want to read from a uri such as a content uri you can use forstream with an inputstream obtained using a content resolver info callbacks you can set an info callback to receive various events including a connection being established and request bodies being sent java request request bridge get https www google com infocallback new infocallback override public void onconnected request request connection to google established override public void onrequestsent request request this method is optional to override indicates request body was sent to google request it s likely that more will be added to this later responses like requests bridge intends to make response interaction super easy response basics the code below should be mostly self explanatory java request request bridge get https www google com request response response request response if response issuccess request returned http status else request returned an http error status you can also have bridge throw an exception in the event that issuccess returns false java try request request bridge get https www google com throwifnotsuccess request response response request response use successful response catch bridgeexception e see the error handling section if you don t need a reference to the request object you can immediately retrieve the response java response response bridge get https www google com response you can retrieve response headers similar to how request headers are set java response response string headervalue response header header name headers can also have multiple values separated by commas java response response list string values response headerlist header name you can even retrieve the full map of headers java response response map string list string headers response headers since content type and content length are commonly used response headers there s two convenience methods for these values java response response string contenttype response contenttype int contentlength response contentlength response bodies bridge includes many methods to make converting responses to object types you need easy the code below should be self explanatory java response response byte responserawdata response asbytes converts asbytes to a utf encoded string string responsestring response asstring cached in the response object using this method multiples will reference the same ason this allows your app to not re parse the json if it s used multiple times ason responseasonobject response asasonobject cached in the response object using this method multiples will reference the same asonarray this allows your app to not re parse the json if it s used multiple times asonarray responseasonarray response asasonarray same as asasonobject just uses the underlying stock jsonobject instance jsonobject responsejsonobject response asjsonobject same as asasonarray just uses the underlying stock jsonarray instance jsonarray responsejsonarray response asjsonarray save the response content to a file of your choosing response asfile new file sdcard download extension response aslinestream if you re not interested in using the request or response object during requests you can immediately retrieve the response body java string responsebody bridge get https www google com asstring asstring could be replaced with any of the body conversion methods above using this will automatically use throwifnotsuccessful so a bridgeexception is thrown in case that the http status code is not error handling the bridgeexception class is used throughout the library and acts as a single exception provider this helps avoid the need for different exception classes or very unspecific exceptions if you wanted you could just display errors to the user using bridgeexception getmessage however bridgeexception lets you know exactly what happened before the user sees anything the bridgeexception reason method returns a constants that indicate why the exception was thrown if the exception is for a request you can retrieve the request with bridgeexception request if the exception is for a response you can retrieve the response with bridgeexception response java bridgeexception e switch e reason case bridgeexception reason request cancelled request request e request used in bridgeexceptions passed to async request callbacks when the associated request was cancelled break case bridgeexception reason request timeout request request e request the request timed out self explanatory obviously break case bridgeexception reason request failed request request e request thrown when a general networking error occurs during a request not including timeouts break case bridgeexception reason response unsuccessful response response e response thrown by throwifnotsuccess when you explicitly want an exception be thrown if the status code was unsuccessful break case bridgeexception reason response unparseable response response e response thrown by the response conversion methods e g asasonobject when the response content can t be successfully returned in the requested format e g a json error break case bridgeexception reason response ioerror response response e response thrown by the asfile response converter when the library is unable to save the content to a file break case bridgeexception reason response validator false case bridgeexception reason response validator error string validatorid e validatorid discussed in the validators section break note you do not need to handle all of these cases everywhere a bridgeexception is thrown the comments within the above example code indicate where those reasons are generally used async up until now all code has been syncronous meaning it gets run on the calling thread android does not allow you to perform networking options on the ui thread for good reasons asyncronous requests become very important when you don t want to handle threading yourself plus bridge comes with some huge advantages when using async methods async requests here s a basic example of an async request obviously get can be replaced with the other http methods such as post java bridge get https www google com throwifnotsuccess optional request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e if e null see the error handling section for information on how to process bridgeexceptions int reason e reason else use the response object string responsecontent response asstring like syncronous requests there are shortcuts to response conversion java bridge get http www google com asstring new responseconvertcallback string override public void onresponse nonnull response response nullable string object nullable bridgeexception e if e null see the error handling section for information on how to process bridgeexceptions int reason e reason else use object parameter not only is the calling thread not blocked duplicate avoidance also comes into the picture see the section below duplicate avoidance duplicate avoidance is a feature of bridge which allows you to avoid making multiple requests to a url at the same time java bridge get http www google com request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use error or response bridge get http www google com request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use error or response the above code requests google s homepage in rapid succession since the first request will most likely not finish before the computer has a chance to begin requesting the second bridge will pool these requests together the second request does not get exectued instead it waits for the first to finish executing and returns the response to both callbacks at the same time there is no limit to how many requests can be pooled bridge s sample project requests an entire page of images but the image is only downloaded once with post put requests duplicate avoidance will also account for request bodies using md hashes if request bodies are different they will be considered two different requests that should both execute upload progress upload progress is pretty straight forward java bridge post https someurl com upload js body pipe foruri this data getdata uploadprogress new progresscallback override public void progress request request int current int total int percent use progress request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use response download progress the callback used to receive asyncronous request results has an optional progress method that can be overidden in your callback java bridge get http someurl com bigfile extension request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use response or error override public void progress request request int current int total int percent progress updates note progress callbacks are only used if the library is able to deetermine the size of the content being downloaded generally this means the requested url needs to return a value for the content length header when it comes to pipe s the pipe handles reporting progress to the progress callback on its own request cancellation request cancellation is another cool feature that bridge specializes in note that it only works with asyncronous requests syncronous requests can t be cancelled since they can block the main thread cancelling single requests the request object has a simple cancel method java request request bridge get https www google com request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use error or response request cancel when the request is cancelled the callback receives a bridgeexception reason will return bridgeexception reason request cancelled most apps will probably ignore the error in this case cancelling multiple requests the bridge class allows you to cancel multiple or all active async requests all active this code will cancel all active requests regardless of method or url java bridge cancelall commit method url regex you can even cancel all active requests that match an http method and a url or regular expression pattern this will cancel all get requests to any url starting with http and ending with png java int count bridge cancelall method method get url http png commit is a wildcard in regular expressions escapes the period to make it literal if you want to cancel all requests to a specific url you can use pattern quote to specify a regex that matches literal text java int count bridge cancelall method method get url pattern quote http www android com media android vector jpg commit tags when making a request you can tag it with a value of any type java bridge get http www google com tag hello request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use response or error you can then cancel all requests which have that tag java bridge cancelall tag hello commit preventing cancellation there are certain situations in which you wouldn t want to allow a request to be cancelled for an example your app may make calls to bridge cancelall commit when an activity pauses that way all requests that were active in that screen are cancelled however there may be a service in your app that s making requests in the background that you would want to maintain you can make those requests non cancellable java bridge get http www google com cancellable false request new callback override public void response request request response response bridgeexception e use response or error this request will be ignored by bridge cancelall unless cancellation is forced java bridge cancelall force commit validation validators allow you to provide consistent checking that certain conditions are true for a response java responsevalidator validator new responsevalidator override public boolean validate nonnull response response throws exception ason json response asasonobjecte return json get success nonnull override public string id return custom validator try ason response bridge get http www someurl com api test validators validator asasonobject catch bridgeexception e if e reason bridgeexception reason response validator false string validatorid e validatorid validator returned false else if e reason bridgeexception reason response validator error string validatorid e validatorid string errormessage e getmessage validator threw an error the validator is passed before the request returns basically the validator will check if a boolean field in the response json called success is equal to true if you had an api on a server that returned true or false for this value you could automatically check if it s true for every request with a single validator you can even use multiple validators for a single request java responsevalidator validatorone responsevalidator validatortwo try ason response bridge get http www someurl com api test validators validatorone validatortwo asasonobject catch bridgeexception e if e reason bridgeexception reason response validator false string validatorid e validatorid validator returned false else if e reason bridgeexception reason response validator error string validatorid e validatorid string errormessage e getmessage validator threw an error notes validators work great with async requests too you can even apply validators to every request in your application by setting global validators discussed below configuration bridge allows you to set various parameters that are maintained as long as your app stays in memory host configuration you can set a host that is used as the base url for every request java bridge config host http www google com with google s homepage set as the host the code below would request http www google com search q hello java bridge get search q s hello asstring basically the url you pass with each request is appended to the end of the host if you were to pass a full url beginning with http in get above it would skip using the host for just that request default headers default headers are headers that are automatically applied to every request you don t have to do it yourself with every request in your app java bridge config defaultheader user agent bridge sample code defaultheader content type application json defaultheader via my app every request regardless of the method will include those headers you can override them at the individual request level by setting the header as you normally would timeout configuration you can configure how long the library will wait until timing out either for connections or reading java bridge config connecttimeout readtimeout you can set timeouts at the request level too java bridge get http someurl com bigvideo mp connecttimeout readtimeout request buffer size the default buffer size is basically when you download a webpage or file the buffer size is how big the byte array is with each pass a large buffer size will create a larger byte array which can affect memory usage but it also increases the pace in which the content is downloaded the buffer size can easily be configured java bridge config buffersize just remember to be careful with how much memory you consume and test on various devices you can set the buffer size at the request level too java bridge get http someurl com bigvideo mp buffersize response note the buffer size is used in a few other places such as pre built pipe s pipe foruri pipe forstream etc logging by default logging is disabled you can enable logging to see what the library is doing in your logcat java bridge config logging true redirects by default automatically following redirects is enabled you can however disable this functionality java bridge config autofollowredirects false you can also set a maximum number of redirects allowed for a single request the default is java bridge config maxredirects global validators validators for individual requests were shown above you can apply validators to every request in your application java bridge config validators new responsevalidator override public boolean validate nonnull response response throws exception ason json response asasonobject return json getboolean success nonnull override public string id return custom validator note you can pass multiple validators into the validators method just like the individual request version cleanup when you re done with bridge e g your app is terminating you should call the destroy method to avoid any memory leaks your app would be fine without this but this is good practice and it helps speed up java s garbage collection java bridge destroy note calling this method will also cancel all active requests for you conversion api bridge s conversion feature allows you to use java object instances arrays lists directly as a request bodies and convert response bodies directly to java object instances arrays lists bridge comes with a built in json converter which is powered by one of my other libraries ason https github com afollestad ason requests take this class for an example java contenttype application json public class person public person public person string name int age this name name this age age header name custom header public string customheader asonname name full name public string name public int age public person spouse asonignore public object idk the contenttype annotation is used to lookup what request converter should be used the annotation s value also gets applied as the content type header of requests that the object is passed in to the header annotation can be used to apply request header values the asonname annotations provide custom names for fields that are serialized into the response body the asonignore annotation tells the library to ignore marked fields during serialization deserialization you can use instances of this class as a request body java person person new person aidan follestad person girlfriend new person waverly moua request request bridge post https someurl com post js body person request you can even send arrays or lists of this object as a request body and it gets converted to a json array java person people new people new person aidan follestad new person waverly moua request request bridge post https someurl com post js body people request responses imagine a url that returns json like this json name aidan follestad age spouse name waverly moua age you can retrieve that url and convert the contents directly to a person instance like this java bridge get https www someurl com person json asclass person class new responseconvertcallback person override public void onresponse nonnull response response nullable person object nullable bridgeexception e use response object you can even retrieve arrays of json json name aidan follestad age spouse name waverly moua age name waverly moua age java arrays bridge get https www someurl com person array json asclassarray person class new responseconvertcallback person override public void onresponse nonnull response response nullable person objects nullable bridgeexception e use response objects lists bridge get https www someurl com person array json asclasslist person class new responseconvertcallback list person override public void onresponse nonnull response response nullable list person objects nullable bridgeexception e use response objects dot notation bridge supports dot notation through ason which is better explained by example take this class java contenttype application json public static class person public person public person string name int age this name name this age age asonname name person name public string name aidan asonname name person age t public int age when converted to json it will appear like this json person name aidan age t the dots in the names of the asonname annotation parameters indicate a path of objects that it takes to reach the value this works with deserialization also if your json keys actually have periods in them you can escape periods in your path with a forward slash for an example with this json java files test txt hello world you can retrieve the value of test txt using the path files test txt custom converters you can create your own converters and assign them to content type s this is what the built in jsonconverter looks like java public class jsonconverter extends iconverter override public byte serialize object object throws exception ason ason ason serialize object return ason tostring getbytes utf override public byte serializearray object objects throws exception asonarray ason ason serializearray objects return ason tostring getbytes utf override public byte serializelist list object objects throws exception asonarray ason ason serializelist objects return ason tostring getbytes utf override public t t deserialize response response class t cls throws exception return ason deserialize response asasonobject cls override public t t deserializearray response response class t cls throws exception return t ason deserialize response asasonarray cls override public t list t deserializelist response response class t cls throws exception return ason deserializelist response asasonarray cls it gets registered by the library like this java bridge config converter application json jsonconverter class

to set the column count simple set the parameter inside your xml layout xml de codecrafters tableview tableview xmlns table http schemas android com apk res auto android id id tableview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent table tableview columncount a second possibility to define the column count of your tableview is to set it directly in the code java tableview tableview tableview findviewbyid r id tableview tableview setcolumncount column width to define the column widths you can set a tablecolumnmodel that defines the width for each column you can use a predefined tablecolumnmodel or implement your custom one tablecolumnweightmodel this model defines the column widths in a relative manner you can define a weight for each column index the default column weight is java tablecolumnweightmodel columnmodel new tablecolumnweightmodel columnmodel setcolumnweight columnmodel setcolumnweight tableview setcolumnmodel columnmodel tablecolumndpwidthmodel this model defines the column widths in a absolute manner you can define a width in density independent pixels for each column index the default column width is dp you can pass a different default to the constructor java tablecolumndpwidthmodel columnmodel new tablecolumndpwidthmodel context columnmodel setcolumnwidth columnmodel setcolumnwidth tableview setcolumnmodel columnmodel tablecolumnpxwidthmodel this model defines the column widths in a absolute manner you can define a width in pixels for each column index the default column width is px you can pass a different default to the constructor java tablecolumnpxwidthmodel columnmodel new tablecolumnpxwidthmodel columnmodel setcolumnwidth columnmodel setcolumnwidth tableview setcolumnmodel columnmodel showing data simple data for displaying simple data like a d string array you can use the simpletabledataadapter the simpletabledataadapter will turn the given strings to textviews http developer android com reference android widget textview html and display them inside the tableview at the same position as previous in the d string array java public class mainactivity extends appcompatactivity private static final string data to show this is a test and a second test override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview string tableview tableview string findviewbyid r id tableview tableview setdataadapter new simpletabledataadapter this data to show custom data for displaying more complex custom data you need to implement your own tabledataadapter therefore you need to implement the getcellview int rowindex int columnindex viewgroup parentview method this method is called for every table cell and needs to returned the view http developer android com reference android view view html that shall be displayed in the cell with the given rowindex and columnindex here is an example of an tabledataadapter for a car object java public class cartabledataadapter extends tabledataadapter car public cartabledataadapter context context list car data super context data override public view getcellview int rowindex int columnindex viewgroup parentview car car getrowdata rowindex view renderedview null switch columnindex case renderedview renderproducerlogo car break case renderedview rendercatname car break case renderedview renderpower car break case renderedview renderprice car break return renderedview the tabledataadapter provides several easy access methods you need to render your cell views like getrowdata getcontext getlayoutinflater getresources sortable data if you need to make your data sortable you should use the sortabletableview instead of the ordinary tableview to make a table sortable by a column all you need to do is to implement a comparator http docs oracle com javase docs api java util comparator html and set it to the specific column java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main sortabletableview setcolumncomparator new carproducercomparator private static class carproducercomparator implements comparator car override public int compare car car car car return car getproducer getname compareto car getproducer getname by doing so the sortabletableview will automatically display a sortable indicator next to the table header of the column with the index by clicking this table header the table is sorted ascending with the given comparator if the table header is clicked again it will be sorted in descending order empty data indicator if you want to show a certain view if there is no data available in the table you can use the setemptydataindicatorview method therefore you first have to add this view to your layout preferable with visibility gone and then pass it to the tableview java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview setemptydataindicatorview findviewbyid r id empty data indicator this view is automatically shown if no data is available and hidden if there is some data to show header data setting data to the header views is identical to setting data to the table cells all you need to do is extending the tableheaderadapter which is also providing the easy access methods that are described for the tabledataadapter if all you want to display in the header is the column title as string like in most cases the simpletableheaderadapter will fulfil your needs to show simple strings inside your table header use the following code java public class mainactivity extends appcompatactivity private static final string table headers this is a test override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate tableview setheaderadapter new simpletableheaderadapter this table headers to show strings from resources inside your table header use the following code java public class mainactivity extends appcompatactivity private static final int table headers r string header col r string header col r string header col override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate tableview setheaderadapter new simpletableheaderadapter this table headers interaction listening data click listening to listen for clicks on data items you can register a tabledataclicklistener the tableview provides a method called adddataclicklistener to register this listeners java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview adddataclicklistener new carclicklistener private class carclicklistener implements tabledataclicklistener car override public void ondataclicked int rowindex car clickedcar string clickedcarstring clickedcar getproducer getname clickedcar getname toast maketext getcontext clickedcarstring toast length short show long data click listening to listen for clicks on data items you can register a tabledatalongclicklistener the tableview provides a method called adddatalongclicklistener to register this columns java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview adddatalongclicklistener new carlongclicklistener private class carlongclicklistener implements tabledatalongclicklistener car override public boolean ondatalongclicked int rowindex car clickedcar string clickedcarstring clickedcar getproducer getname clickedcar getname toast maketext getcontext clickedcarstring toast length short show return true the main difference to the tabledataclicklistener ondataclicked method is that the ondatalongclicked method has a boolean as return value this boolean indicates if the tabledatalongclicklistener has consumed the click event if none of the registered tabledatalongclicklisteners has consumed the click event the tabledataclicklisteners are informed in addition header click listening to listen for clicks on headers you can register a tableheaderclicklistner the tableview provides a method called addheaderclicklistener to do so java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview addheaderclicklistener new myheaderclicklistener private class myheaderclicklistener implements tableheaderclicklistener override public void onheaderclicked int columnindex string notifytext clicked column columnindex toast maketext getcontext notifytext toast length short show on scroll listening to listen for scroll or scroll state changes you can register a onscrolllistener the tableview provides a method called addonscrolllistener to do so java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview addonscrolllistener new myonscrolllistener private class myonscrolllistener implements onscrolllistener override public void onscroll final listview tabledataview final int firstvisibleitem final int visibleitemcount final int totalitemcount listen for scroll changes override public void onscrollstatechanged final listview tabledateview final scrollstate scrollstate listen for scroll state changes in addition this library provides an endlessonscrolllistener which allows the loading of further data when the user scrolls to the end of the table therefore you can give an row threshold which defines when the data shall be reloaded a threshold of would mean that the loading shall be triggered when the user reaches the rd last row the default threshold is java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview addonscrolllistener new myendlessonscrolllistener private class myendlessonscrolllistener extends endlessonscrolllistener override public void onreloadingtriggered final int firstrowitem final int visiblerowcount final int totalrowcount show a loading view to the user reload some data add the loaded data to the adapter hide the loading view styling header styling the table view provides several possibilities to style its header one possibility is to set a color for the header therefore you can adapt the xml file or add it to your code xml de codecrafters tableview tableview xmlns table http schemas android com apk res auto android id id tableview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent table tableview headercolor color primary java tableview setheaderbackgroundcolor getresources getcolor r color primary for more complex header styles you can also set a drawable as header background using the following method java tableview setheaderbackground r drawable linear gradient in addition you can set an elevation of the table header to achieve this you have the possibility to set the elevation in xml or alternatively set it in your code xml de codecrafters tableview tableview xmlns table http schemas android com apk res auto android id id tableview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent table tableview headerelevation java tableview setheaderelevation note this elevation is realized with the app compat version of elevation so it is also applicable on pre lollipop devices for sortabletableviews it is also possible to replace the default sortable indicator icons by your custom ones to do so you need to implement the sortstateviewprovider and set it to your sortabletableview java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main sortabletableview setheadersortstateviewprovider new mysortstateviewprovider private static class mysortstateviewprovider implements sortstateviewprovider private static final int no image res override public int getsortstateviewresource sortstate state switch state case sortable return r mipmap ic sortable case sorted asc return r mipmap ic sorted asc case sorted desc return r mipmap ic sorted desc default return no image res there is also a factory class existing called sortstateviewproviders where you can get some predefined implementations of the sortstateviewprovider data row styling in general you can do all your styling of data content in your custom tabledataadapter but if you want to add a background for the whole table rows you can use the tabledatarowbackgroundprovider there are already some implementations of the tabledatarowbackgroundprovider existing in the library you can get them by using the factory class tabledatarowbackgroundproviders this factory contains for example an alternating table data row row provider that will color rows with even index different from rows with odd index java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main int colorevenrows getresources getcolor r color white int coloroddrows getresources getcolor r color gray tableview setdatarowbackgroundprovider tabledatarowbackgroundproviders alternatingrowcolors colorevenrows coloroddrows if the implementations of tabledatarowbackgroundprovider contained in the tabledatarowbackgroundproviders factory don t fulfil you needs you can create your own implementation of tabledatarowbackgroundprovider here is a small example of how to do so java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate setcontentview r layout activity main tableview setdatarowbackgroundprovider new carpricerowcolorprovider private static class carpricerowcolorprovider implements tabledatarowbackgroundproviders car override public drawable getrowbackground final int rowindex final car car int rowcolor getresources r color white if car getprice rowcolor getresources r color light green else if car getprice rowcolor getresources r color light red return new colordrawable rowcolor this background provider will set the background color of each row corresponding to the price of the car that is displayed at in this row cheap cars less then get a green background expensive cars more then get a red background and all other cars get a white background seperator styling if you want to have a seperator between the data rows you can do so by specifying it in the xml like known from the listview java de codecrafters tableview tableview android id id tableview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent android divider color black android dividerheight dip as for the listview you can specify divider as a drawable and dividerheight as the vertical size of the divider swipe to refresh the tableview has a build in swipetorefresh action by default this is disabled but you can easily enable it using the follwing line java tableview setswipetorefreshenabled true this enables the user to trigger the table refresh on a single swipe to listen for this user interaction you have to set an swipetorefreshlistener to your tableview java cartableview setswipetorefreshlistener new swipetorefreshlistener override public void onrefresh final refreshindicator refreshindicator your async refresh action goes here the callback method has the refreshindicator that is shown to the user passed as parameter so if you finished your refresh action simply call refreshindicator hide hide table header to hide the header of the tableview just call the setheadervisible false method you can do this also with animation calling setheadervisibile false where the second parameter is the duration of the animation to make the header visible again just call setheadervisible true or setheadervisible true hide show table header on scroll to hide an show the table header when the user is scrolling just use the tableheadercollapseonscrolllistener java cartableview setonscrolllistener new tableheadercollapseonscrolllistener cartableview by default the tableheadercollapseonscrolllistener will hide the header when the user scrolls two rows to the bottom or shows it again when scrolling two rows to top to change this you can call tableheadercollapseonscrolllistener setrowoffset int with your preferred offset to enable animation you can call tableheadercollapseonscrolllistener setanimationduration int with your preferred animation duration state persistence the tableview as well as the sortabletableview will persist its state automatically e g on orientation change if you want to disable this behaviour you can do so using the following code snipped java tableview setsaveenabled false license copyright ingo schwarz licensed

superbus name suggestions welcome is a synchronization bus service for android we ve built several projects that need to do background syncing this is the functionality that emerged from that this is highly slanted towards network communication but it could in theory be used for architecting a local storage scheduling system or whatever ok v was promised soon not sure this qualified as soon but v is here testing is happening in apps but we should be having some real testing soon the docs written for the old version are conceptually correct but syntactically old command creation is relatively current in docs but not config the config and setup is somewhat different now lots of code was pulled there used to be many ways to store command lists now its just sql there used to be many command storage implementations now its just gson although you could implement your own there s also support for sqlciper so you can have encrypted bus storage although that hasn t yet been tested in any way coming also in the near future you can choose command based or state based sync my offline sync theory concocted this whole command based plan and like all new fancy ideas i pushed on it too hard not all situations need a command bus however even state based sync could use some nice coordination some other changes are coming short story we ve learned a lot and that learning keeps going

etc package organization package by layer v s package by feature read more about the package organization part of this blog http fernandocejas com architecting android the evolution and package by feature not layer http www javapractices com topic topicaction do id both features and models are packaged by their functions users and repos are model modules each one provides a repo api for upper level modules splash and trending are feature modules each one is a standalone module implementing a single feature all modules can be composed together as a full apk containing all features module organization modules are organized by contributors in the contrib dir that can separate code and responsibility as much as possible because each person has his own style and flavor others should obey the style of contributor in each module that s a very clear rule feature modules are decomposed that makes each feature module as lightweight as possible and activity is launched through string url business contains app specific business code configurations etc bridge module is just like a bridge connecting modules together like the image above build tips sign key config place keystore file in

have tried to create a well architected project from scratch with well designed network layer data layer asynchronous execution communication between modules and last but not least unit test and integrated testing support after several months of development we found some drawbacks of our current architecture and also found some popular architectures then i decided to extract our original well designed architecture and make it open source with amendment according to the drawbacks and features from the new popular architectures we ve found recently i have seen a lot of bootstrap base android projects including jakewharton s u https github com jakewharton u mobiwiseco s android base project https github com mobiwiseco android base project etc but none of these projects cover all the
