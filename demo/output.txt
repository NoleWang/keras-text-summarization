nativescript keyframes understanding keyframes model objects image an image in keyframes consists of a number of important fields which together describe an animated and scalable image at the top level an image contains information about how to scale canvas size an image as well as how to play back an animation at the correct speed frame rate frame count the animation itself is not bound to the discrete frame rate that the image was extracted at as the keyframes rendering library supports fractional frames in addition to these global parameters of an image an image also contains a number of feature s which describe different shapes to be drawn as well as animation group s which describe transforms that can be applied to multiple feature s or even other animation group s at once let s break down this simple image of a star against a circle scaling up and down the animation was exported at fps and the frame number is shown in the top left corner as well as the scale of the star on the bottom star real time docs images doc star realtime gif let s slow that down a bit frame by frame star slowwwww docs images doc star slow gif features a feature is any independent visual object of the image most important it includes shape drawing commands presented very similary to svg type commands which describe the feature s shape at any given time a feature may belong to a larger animation group as well as contain features specific animations of its own including a specialized stroke width animation the shape of a feature can also change over time using the same keyframe and interpolator pattern described below shape a shape is any list of line drawing commands which strung together describe a continuous line or closed shape that can be filled or stroked the commands are given as a series of move line quadratic and cubic commands one after another here are the important shapes for the above image along with vertices squares and control points circles if relevant circle shape docs images doc circle shape png star shape docs images doc star shape png animations transforms the keyframes rendering library includes support for the common matrix based transform operations scale rotate and translate for feature s specifically an additional non matrix stroke width is available animation s may belong to specific feature s or as part of a larger animation group animation progression the values of a transform of an animation and how they change during the playback of an animation are determined by two key fields keyframe s and timing curves using the combination of the two fields we can calculate back a value for a transform at any specified time in the animation keyframes are specific frames in the animation that have specific target values for example in scaling a shape up and back down over frames we will want to start and end at scale at the th and th frame and hit our max scale of on the th frame in this example our key frames for the scale transform for this shape would be with the values respectively timing curves describe the pace with which a transform changes between each keyframe each timing curve is modeled as a cubic bezier curve from point to where the x value is the progression in time from the origin keyframe to the destination keyframe and the y value describes the amount of change in the value at a given time origvalue destvalue origvalue y for our scaling star image the graph of scale change over time looks like this with vertices and timing curve in out values shown scale animation curve docs images doc scale curve png tying it all together with these fields from an image object as well as a progress value we can build back all of the shapes of the image at a given time as well as any transformations to apply to the shapes and draw back the image at that frame because the animations are driven by flexible timing curves a keyframes image is not limited to discrete integer frames for playback but it is important to note that all progress values are given in relation to the frame count this means a frame animation accepts all values in the range contributing see contributing md contributing md for

content related to the current application building a good user interface to stand for this behavior might be anoying or simply do not fit in the developer s time window thinking in those situations custom searchable is a library that intends to provide a clean gmail like search interface why should i use custom searchable instead of android search interface android search interface http

how to use a how to use as said before this library was build upon the same model as android search interface http developer android com guide topics search search dialog html or at least i ve tried to do so therefore it is implied that the control of the content to display as result to the user search is of developer s responsability there are basically two types of content that can be displayed recent suggestions displays suggestions based on the user recent typed queries custom suggestions performs some processing over the user s typed data and deliveries some feedback based on its result both methods discribed above work with content providers if you never have worked with them i suggest read this http developer android com guide topics providers content provider creating html article

wire protocol buffers a man got to have a code omar little as our teams and programs grow the variety and volume of data also grows success will turn your simple data models into complex ones whether your application is storing data to disk or transmitting it over a network the structure and interpretation of that data should be clear consumers work best with data they understand schemas describe and document data models if you have data you should have a schema protocol buffers google s protocol buffers google protos are built around a great schema language it s cross platform and language independent whatever programming language you use you ll be able to use proto schemas with your application proto schemas are backwards compatible and future proof you can evolve your schema as your application loses old features and gains new ones it s focused proto schemas describe your data models that s it here s a sample message definition proto syntax proto package squareup dinosaurs option java package com squareup dinosaurs import squareup geology period proto message dinosaur common name of this dinosaur like stegosaurus optional string name urls with images of this dinosaur repeated string picture urls optional squareup geology period period and here s an enum definition proto syntax proto package squareup geology option java package com squareup geology enum period million years ago million years ago cretaceous million years ago million years ago jurassic million years ago million years ago triassic this schema language is protocol buffers best feature you might even use it purely for documentation purposes such as to describe a json api protocol buffers also defines a compact binary encoding of messages that conform to the schema this encoding is fast to encode fast to decode small to transmit and small to store the binary encoding uses numeric tags from the schema like the for period above for example let s encode this dinosaur name stegosaurus period jurassic the encoded value is just bytes hex description a tag name field encoding length delimited b stegosaurus length s t e g f o s a u r u s tag period field encoding varint jurassic why wire the protocol buffers schema language and binary encoding are both defined by google wire is an independent implementation from square that s specifically designed for android and java for each message type defined in the schema wire generates an immutable model class and its builder the generated code looks like code you d write by hand it s documented formatted and simple wire s apis should feel at home to programmers who like effective java effective java that said there are some interesting design decisions in wire wire messages declare public final fields instead of the usual getter methods this cuts down on both code generated and code executed less code is particularly beneficial for android programs wire avoids case mapping a field declared as picture urls in a schema yields a java field picture urls and not the conventional pictureurls camel case though the name feels awkward at first it s fantastic whenever you use grep or more sophisticated search tools no more mapping when navigating between schema java source code and data it also provides a gentle reminder to calling code that proto messages are a bit special primitive types are always boxed if a field is absent its value is null this is used for naturally optional fields such as a dinosaur whose period is unknown a field may also be null due to schema evolution if tomorrow we add a carnivore boolean to our message definition today s data won t have a value for that field here s the compact generated code for the dinosaur message defined above java code generated by wire protocol buffer compiler do not

sources goal goals configuration includes proto package names to generate code for include squareup dinosaurs include include squareup geology include includes configuration execution executions plugin plugins build wire can read proto files from the local file system and from within jar files the compiler can optionally prune your schema to a subset of root types and their transitive dependencies this is useful when sharing a schema between projects a java service and android app may each use a subset of a larger shared schema if you don t use maven the compiler also has a command

 introduction meltdown is an open source android client for fever rss http feedafever com this is me trying to solve a personal need i want a good rss reader on my new hardware from google i o and that lovely nexus screen really demands a good feed reader it s written for people with lots of rss feeds preferably organized into groups with lots of news items i also put a lot of effort into the sync code so you can easily read news in multiple places and not see duplicates to use it you must have an installed copy of fever server http feedafever com this is just a client please email me mailto phubbard gmail com if you want to hack on it i can always use help as my time is limited current features speed in memory data structures with on disk json files for entries nice and fast no excess graphical crap just fast text and listview display designed for high volume consumers of rss like myself my goal was to make this super fast low battery usage uses alarm service and background process to refresh the lists every fifteen minutes using the inexact repeating mode to avoid excess wakeups compressed downloads if your apache is configured it ll transfer the data using gzip compression to save time and bytes ssl support as of the communications code uses httpurlconnection and thus inherits ssl support you have to have a working chain of trust root ca but it works fine with my seven dollar ssl cert from godaddy local cache all items are encoded as json and written to disk so if you reboot or kill the app it won t need to re pull everything again http response cache added as of uses mb of disk to speed things up as per android recommendations asynchronous mark as read and mark as saved using asynctask when you hit next it s done in the background in the item view in addition to the ususal sharing menu i ve also added a tickler file function this lets you set a calendar entry to remind yourself in a week or whenever i use this to do things like remind me to check this out in a couple weeks when it s due to ship very handy uses efficient and secure localbroadcastmanager to communicate between the background service and the foreground views no excessive permissions requires only internet and run in background permissions does not use or need any data or other apps inspect the code and build it yourself if you like no phone home bs i hate that so should you at no time will it ever contact anything other than the server you designate read in multiple places the next sync will remove anything you ve already seen or you can hit refresh manually at any time does not have group management or feed management the fever api has not added these and i tend to think they re better done via the fever web app anyway simple flow oriented interface feed title and author at the top of the screen followed by title and content the bottom of the screen has the load url button the timestamp using human readable relative time strings such as hours ago and the next button two buttons everything else is in the share menu and options menu current status working code current bugs and in progress available on the google app store https play google com store apps details id net phfactor meltdown feature search result t w bgwsmswyldesim ldc wagzhy rvci tzwx zg bijd and amazon app store http www amazon com gp product b a cubcy if you want to try it in your browser try appsurfer here http www appsurfer com apps meltdown and it should work future plans and ideas switch to eventbus for service activity sync seems to work well and would solve a set of bugs coalesce mark as read and do them all at once when the downloader runs would help reduce battery usage since every mark will fire up the radio and stack swipe gestures left for save right for mark as read ideas from tomas varil the listviews work fine on my nexus tablet and present an info dense display but i d like to try fragments and a landscape mode two column display there especially now that the nexus is out add favicons to item list i wrote the code to download the favicons but am still trying to figure out where they add utility use persistent notifications to show background fetches nice and unobtrusive more preferences tabbed interface for unread read sparks kindling saved background information tools and credits the fever rest api http feedafever com api is elegant simple and returns either json or xml i can think of no reason to use xml so json it is the api widget https github com phubbard meltdown blob master scripts api widget html is really helpful for poking at the api and responses i m also using this graphical http client http httpclient uservoice com as well which helped me sort out the header needed to get authentication working the scripts directory has a copy of the widget for convenience since i m developing for the galaxy nexus and nexus the current target api is but it could probably run on older devices i also develop and test on my galaxy s verizon the code from rssreader java is copyright by the android open source project under the apache license http www apache org licenses license for which i am grateful the listitem stuff is poorly documented so that code was a big help i used their listview and excerpt code nearly verbatim license this code is open source under the cc by http creativecommons org licenses by us terms i d appreciate a note if you make use of it please other than that i d be pleased if you found it useful either whole or in part

swipeactionadapter the mailbox like swipe gesture library maven central https img shields io maven central v com wdullaer swipeactionadapter svg swipeactionadapter is a library that provides a simple api to create mailbox like action when swiping in a listview the idea is to make it simple enough to implement while still providing sufficient options to allow you to integrate it with the design of your application support for android and up it might work on lower api versions but i haven t tested it and i don t intend to make any effort in that direction feel free to fork or issue pull requests on github issues can be reported on the github issue tracker normal swipe gesture https raw github com wdullaer swipeactionadapter gh pages images swipe png far swipe gesture https raw github com wdullaer swipeactionadapter gh pages images swipe png setup there are multiple options to add swipeactionadapter to your project grade add it as a dependency to your build gradle java dependencies compile com wdullaer swipeactionadapter jar file download the jar file https github com wdullaer swipeactionadapter releases latest and add it to your project build from source if you would like to get the most recent code in a jar clone the project and run gradlew jar from the root folder this will build a swipeactionadapter jar in library build libs you may also add the library as an android library to your project all the library files live in library the library also uses some java features which android studio will need to transpile this requires the following stanza in your app s build gradle see https developer android com studio write java support html for more information on java support in android groovy android configure only for each module that uses java language features either in its source code or through dependencies compileoptions sourcecompatibility javaversion version targetcompatibility javaversion version creating your listview with swipe actions if you d rather just start with a working example clone the project and take a look for a basic implementation you ll need to wrap the adapter of your listview with a swipeactionadapter create a background layout for each swipe direction you wish to act upon implement the swipeactionadapter wrap the adapter of your listview the majority of this libraries functionality is provided through an adapter which wraps around the content adapter of your listview you will need to set the swipeactionadapter to your listview and because we need to set some properties of the listview you will also need to give a reference of the listview to the swipeactionadapter this is typically done in your activity s or fragments oncreate onactivitycreated callbacks java protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate create an adapter for your content string content new string for int i i i content i row i arrayadapter string stringadapter new arrayadapter

swipedirection direction return true if you want this item to be swipeable in this direction boolean shoulddismiss int position swipedirection direction return true if you want the item to be dismissed return false if it should stay visible this method runs on the interface thread so if you want to trigger any heavy actions here put them on an asyncthread void onswipe int position

evernote sdk for android version rc evernote api version overview this sdk wraps the evernote cloud api http dev evernote com documentation cloud and provides oauth authentication functionality the sdk is provided as an android library project that can be included in your application with gradle prerequisites in order to use the code in this sdk you need to obtain an api key from https dev evernote com doc you ll also find full api documentation on that page in order to run the demo code you need a user account on the sandbox service where you will do your development sign up for an account at https sandbox evernote com registration action the instructions below assume you have the latest android sdk http developer android com sdk index html download add the library as a dependency in your build gradle file groovy dependencies compile com evernote android sdk rc optional using a snapshot build for early access previews add sonatype s snapshot repository in your build script groovy maven url https oss sonatype org content repositories snapshots add the snapshot depdendency groovy dependencies compile com evernote android sdk snapshot demo app the demo application evernote sdk demo demonstrates how to use the evernote sdk for android to authentication to the evernote service using oauth then access the user s evernote account the demo code provides multiple activities that show notebook listing note creation and resource creation in two scenarios a plain text note creator and an image saver running the demo app from android studio to build and run the demo project from android studio open android studio choose import project eclipse adt gradle etc select the sdk root directory the directory containing this readme and click ok add your evernote api consumer key and secret see below adding evernote api consumer key and secret you have two different options to add your consumer key and secret gradle properties file preferred open the folder gradle in your user s home directory open or create a file called gradle properties add a line evernote consumer key your consumer key add a line evernote consumer secret your consumer secret in code open the class com evernote android demo demoapp java at the top of demoapp java fill in your evernote api consumer key and secret usage sdk modify your androidmanifest xml the sdk s oauth functionality is implemented as an android activity that must be declared in your app s androidmanifest xml starting with android gradle plugin version the necessary activities are merged in your app s androidmanifest xml file and you don t need to do anything otherwise simply copy and paste the following snippet into your androidmanifest xml within the application section xml activity android name com evernote

application object or your parent activity object java mevernotesession new evernotesession builder this setevernoteservice evernote service setsupportapplinkednotebooks support app linked notebooks build consumerkey consumersecret assingleton give the user a way to initiate authentication in our demo app we have a login button that initiates the authentication process you might choose to do something similar or you might simply initiate authentication the first time that the user tries to access evernote related functionality the recommended approach is to use fragmentactivity s then the authentication process opens a dialog and no extra activity but normal activity s are supported as well java mevernotesession authenticate this evernote and yinxiang biji service bootstrapping the activity that completes the oauth authentication automatically determines if the user is on the evernote service or the yinxiang service and configures the end points automatically if you want to test if bootstrapping works within your app you can either change the device s language to chinese or you can set a specific locale object in the session builder e g new evernotesession builder this setlocale locale simplified chinese if the sdk can t decide which server to use then the user has the option to change the evernote service while authenticating complete authentication if you use a

 rxmvp android this is a sample project to demonstrate various ways to use the model view presenter pattern on android it has a focus on how to integrate cleanly in difference ways with rxjava and its subscriptions notes i deviate slightly from the strict mvp pattern by letting the views format the model data for themselves this allows the presenters to be re used across various views there are activities that use the same presenter but in different ways one activity uses a standard base activity to start and finish the presenter note the presenter holds the subscriber and unsubscribes in finish the last activity uses a fatter custom view with a presenter attached this is the pattern i tend to move towards for modularity if you have any questions or comments please open an issue
